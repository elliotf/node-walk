= node-walk

recursively walk directories.

See the examples directory for an example.

= another recursive readdir library?

I'm afraid so.  The other libraries have a sync method that return all of the paths at once or an async method that doesn't tell you when you've seen all of the paths.

I attempted to extend another library but the tests didn't pass to begin with.
